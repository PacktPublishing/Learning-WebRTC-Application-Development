# Learning WebRTC Application Development [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning WebRTC Application Development [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-webrtc-application-development-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783989904), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
WebRTC revolutionizes the way users can communicate over the Internet. It enables browser-to-browser communication and saves you from mundane tasks such as installation and registration, and makes voice and video communication a breeze. To add to this, you can access the application from any platform such as home PC, mobile devices, and access points.

This video course will help you learn the fundamentals of developing real-time communication systems using WebRTC.
Start right from the basics of the WebRTC standard that includes the signaling channels such as the Google App Engine. Develop file sharing functionalities and transfer media content from your mic and webcam for a better user experience. Finally, you will discover WebRTC wrapper libraries that will help you integrate the technology in your existing application within seconds. 
By the end of the course, you will have a fully working application that enables real-time browser-to-browser communication.

CryENGINE 3 SDK Level Design covers various aspects of level design while informing the budding designer of ways to achieve their goals with less effort. Even with no prior knowledge of game design, CryENGINE 3 SDK Level Design will show you everything you need to know about game level design, starting from how to load the CryENGINE 3 SDK on to your PC all the way to packing up your first level to play.

In order to make your game level look presentable, the course starts off by helping you get a grasp on the basics, such as creating your first level, working with models, terrain creation, and material editing. However, your journey doesn't stop there, as you will then gain further knowledge of more advanced features such as creating flowgraphs and particles, adding sound, and debugging your level.

By the end of this course, you will be armed with the skills you need to start creating game levels and scenes. While watching these videos, you will learn game creation tactics that not only work for the CryENGINE, but also for most modern day game engines.

Code bundle of this course comes along with the game created in the video course with the CryENGINE Free SDK Version 3.4.5
